## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the selection of biocompatibility tests for medical implants. This website provides a convenient tool for users to identify the required tests based on their implant's specifications and intended use. By making this process more accessible, we aim to support researchers, engineers, and medical professionals in ensuring the safety and compliance of their implant designs.

## Usage

To access the **Biocompatibility Test Selector Website**, simply follow this link: [Biocompatibility Test Selector Website](https://biocompatibility-test-selector.neocities.org/). Once on the website, users can input information about their implant, such as its material, intended use, and specific characteristics. The website will then provide recommendations for biocompatibility tests based on open-source documents and guidelines.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the following sources for their valuable contributions to this project:

- **FDA (USA) Documents**: The project relies on open-source documents provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information.

- **ISO 10933 Series**: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10933 series of standards has been instrumental in shaping the biocompatibility testing guidelines used in this project.

- **TUV SUD**: We appreciate the resources and insights offered by TUV SUD, which have helped inform the selection criteria for biocompatibility tests.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while the **Biocompatibility Test Selector Website** is a valuable tool for simplifying the test selection process, it does not claim to cover all possible scenarios. The information provided is based on open-source documents, and users should exercise due diligence to ensure that their specific implant project meets all necessary regulatory and safety requirements.
